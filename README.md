# React Hooks Carousel 3

## What's New

- Static imports for images in place of [Webpack's `require.context` API](https://webpack.js.org/guides/dependency-management/)
- Custom context provider and custom hooks for state and dispatch. ([source](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively))
- Debugging React App: check spell errors in state and props
  - `state.isPlaing`
  - `props.cliedk`

## Memo

- Design mobile-first on next iteration.
